# hello-world
My first repository!


Hi there! My name is Kat.

I am a mountain girl from the heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Growing up in the Rocky Mountains gave me a great appreciation for the outdoors and how beautiful natural resources are.

I love photography, eating good food and spending time with my loved ones.

I am learning how to code and so far I really enjoy it!
